  1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

  1 green pepper, chopped            2 large onions, chopped
  1 bunch green onions, sliced       5 celery stalks, chopped
    thinly (green tops too!)         1 Tbs garlic, minced
  3 bags frozen cut okra
 ROUX (pronounced roo)
  1 1/2 cups shortening or bacon     1 1/2 cups flour
    drippings.

 4. In a LARGE pot, heat 3 quarts of chicken broth (or water) with
    the spices.

    slotted spoon and add to chicken broth.

 7. Brown the ham in the bacon grease.  Remove and add to the broth.

 8. Add oil to the skillet to make about 1 1/2 cups (bacon drippings are
    more flavorful, but shortening or oil will do).

    wil take 45 minutes or more.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO BURN THE ROUX, IT

    Serve over cooked rice with red pepper sauce to individual taste.
    Gumbo freezes and reheats well.  It works best to make it a day
    ahead, put pot in refrigerator, and the fat will congeal and can
    removed easily.  Then reheat over low heat.
