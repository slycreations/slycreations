            SUGAR FREE MILE HIGH APPLE PIE

  2 deep dish pie crusts,            7 1/4 tsp Equal Measure or 24
    thawed                             packets Equal or 1 cup Equal
  3/4 tsp cinnamon                     Spoonful
  1/4 tsp nutmeg                     8 medium Granny Smith apples
  1/4 tsp salt                         (about 8 cups) peeled, cored, and
  3 Tbs cornstarch                     sliced

 1. Heat oven to 425 degrees.

 2. Mix the cornstarch, Equal, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Sprinkle
    over the apples and toss to coat the apples evenly.

 3. Put the apples in one deep dish pie crust (they will pile high, thus
    the name).

 4. Roll the second pie crust to make a top crust and place on the pie.

 5. Seal the edges, flute, and trim.  Cut 5 or 6 slits in the center of
    the top crust.  Brush the top crust lightly with milk.

 6. Bake 50 minutes and cool completely on a wire rack.  One serving is
    1/8 of the pie.

 NOTE: This makes excellent baked apples too!  Do Steps 1 and 2.  Put
       2 Tbs water in an 8 X 11 baking dish and put the apples in the
       dish.  Cover with foil and bake 30 - 40 minutes (until apples are
       tender).
