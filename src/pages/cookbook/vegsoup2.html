                    CROCK POT VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP           (Debbie)

  1 lb. lean stew meat               1 16 oz can yellow corn
  1 16 oz can cut green beans        1 16 oz can sliced carrots
  1 16 oz can sliced potatoes        1 8 oz can tomato sauce
  salt and pepper                    water

 1. Cut beef into bite size pieces, generously salt and pepper, and put
    in a crock pot.

 2. Drain all veggies and add to the crock pot along with the tomato
    sauce.

 3. Add water to cover meat and veggies.

 4. Cook in crock pot on low until meat is done ( about 6 - 8 hours).

 Note: Debbie uses all generic vegetables.  I found that the addition
       of 2 beef bouillon cubes and 1 tsp onion powder makes it much
       more tasty.
