                      OVEN-BARBECUED BRISKET

  1 whole brisket (fat and all)      6 Tbs liquid smoke flavoring
  6 Tbs worcestershire sauce         6 tsp celery seed
  6 tsp pepper                       3 tsp salt
  3 tsp onion salt                   3 tsp garlic salt
  1/2 cup italian salad dressing     red pepper sauce
  any good barbecue sauce of your choice

 1. In a bowl, combine liquid smoke, worcestershire, celery seed,
    pepper, salt, onion salt, garlic salt, italian dressing, and about
    2 heavy dashes of pepper sauce.  Mix well.

 2. Put brisket on a cutting board and poke holes all over it with a
    meat fork on both sides (you can work out all your frustration on
    this).  Make sure there are a lot of holes.   End on the non-fatty
    side.

 3. Rub the marinade mix all over the non fatty side and place the
    brisket in a deep baking pan.  Pour the remaining marinade (rub to
    make sure it is covered well) over the fatty side.

 4. Cover (plastic wrap works best for this) and refrigerate overnight.

 5. Remove plastic wrap, cover tightly with foil, and bake covered for
    6 to 7 hours at 250 degrees.

 6. Carefully remove from oven, uncover, and remove brisket to a cutting
    board.  As soon as you can work with it, remove the fat.  You should
    end up with 2 large slabs of beef.  It works best to let it cool
    before slicing, however you can slice it warm but it will come apart
    easily. Serve hot with warm barbecue sauce on the side (Texas style)
