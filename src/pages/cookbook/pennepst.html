                      PENNE PASTA

  1 lb penne rigate pasta            1 lb lean ground beef
  2 26 oz jars mushroom or basil     4 cups (1 lb) shredded mozzarella
    spaghetti sauce                    cheese
    parsley flakes                     salt and pepper

 NOTE: I use Five brothers sauce.

 1. Cook penne rigate pasta in boiling salted water for 10 minutes (or
    as package directs for firm cooked pasta).

 2. While water is heating and pasta is cooking, brown meat with salt
    and pepper (I use 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper).  Drain and put in
    a large bowl.

 3. Add sauce and 2 cups (8 oz) cheese, mix well.

 4. When pasta is done, drain and add to the sauce, mixing well.

 5. Turn mix into a 9 X 13 baking dish and bake in a 350 degree oven for
    45 minutes.

 6. Top with the remaining cheese, sprinkle with parsley flakes and bake
    for another 10 minutes.
