               PRESSURE COOKER SAUERBRATEN            (Sherry)



  4.5 - 5 pound boneless beef chuck roast (use 2 smaller 
   roasts if you can't find a large one)
  2 cups water or broth
  1 cup red wine
  1 cup apple cider vinegar
  1 lemon, thinly sliced
  1 small onion, diced
  4 clove garlic, diced
  1 teaspoon whole peppercorns
  10 whole cloves
  3 bay leaves
  2 tablespoons white sugar

1.  Prep the roast by trimming off gristle, silver skin, and any 
    excessively thick areas of fat around the roast. 
   
2.  Heat water, red wine, cider vinegar, lemon, onion, garlic, 
    cloves, bay leaves, white sugar, salt, juniper berries, and 
    peppercorns in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar is 
    dissolved, about 5 minutes. 

3.  Allow marinade to cool and pour into a large resealable plastic 
    bag or non-reactive container.  Add beef roast, coat with 
    marinade, seal. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 3 days, 
    turning the roast twice a day.

    
  2 tablespoons of oil 
  2 tablespoons salt
  1 tablespoon juniper berries, crushed (optional)
  1 teaspoon black pepper
  2 cups chopped onions
  2 cups chopped carrots
  1 cup diced celery
  1 red bell pepper, diced (optional, but delish)
  8 gingersnap cookies, crushed

1.  Heat oil in a large skillet.

2.  Place remaining ingredients *except ginger snaps* into a pressure 
    cooker. 

3.  Wipe off any ingredients clinging to the roast then move to the 
    skillet to brown the roast on all sides.

4.  Strain the marinade to separate liquid from solids. Discard solids.

5.  Place the browned roast atop vegetables and pour 3 1/2 cups marinade
    liquid over roast. 

6.  Place cover on pressure cooker, turn heat to high and bring to high 
    pressure (10 pounds).

7.  When pressure is reached, reduce heat to maintain high pressure and 
    set timer for 45 minutes.

8.  When time is up, turn off the burner and let the pressure come down 
    naturally (~15 minutes).

9.  When pressure has dropped, open cooker and move the roast to a 
    cutting board.

10.  Strain the liquid into a sauce pot and add the gingersnaps. Cook over 
    medium-high heat, stirring often, until sauce has thickened, about 
    10 minutes. 

11.  If you are a traditionalist, discard the veggies -- or if you're 
    like me, toss them back into thickened gravy. 

12.  Slice roast and serve with gravy.


Note:  If you don't have a pressure cooker, just roast in a covered dish, 
at 350 degrees, for about 2.5 hours.
