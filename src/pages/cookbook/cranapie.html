			CRANBERRY APPLE PIE                    (Sherry)

  4  large or 6 small apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
  1  16-oz can Ocean Spray Whole Cranberry Sauce
  1/4 cup brown sugar
  1/2 cup white sugar
  1/4 cup flour
  1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
  1/2 tsp. nutmeg
  1/2 tsp. ground clove
  pie crust for deep dish 9-in. 2 crust pie

  1. Preheat oven to 375.

  2. Combine apples and cranberry sauce.  (I usually put the cranberry
     sauce in the bowl for a minute and remove any water that pools in
     the bottom.)  Combine sugars, flour, and spices in a separate
     mixing bowl;  add to apple mixture, mixing well.

  3. Turn into a pastry lined pan.  Cover with an open top crust.
     (Either lattice style crust, or cut crust into circles approx.
     4" diameter and arrange on the center of the filling.)  Crimp
     edges of crust.  Bake for 50 minutes or until crust is golden
     brown and filling bubbles.  Bake on lower rack of oven, over a
     cookie sheet, since it may bubble over some. Makes one 9-inch pie.
