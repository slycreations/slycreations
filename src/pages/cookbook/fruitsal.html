  canned pineapple chunks with       apples, cut up, peeled or unpeeled
    juice                            seedless orange segments
  seedless red or white grapes       kiwi fruit, sliced
  bananas, sliced

 1. In a bowl, commensurate with size of salad to be made, put the
    pineapple and juice. (A rule of thumb is 1 16 oz can for every 2
    apples which will be chopped.)

 2. Add cut up apples and stir to cover apple pieces with pineapple
    juice. (The pineapple juice keeps the apples and bananas from
    turning dark.)

 3. Add the grapes, oranges, and some of the kiwi.  (The remaining kiwi
    is used to decorate the top of the salad.)

 4. Add the bananas, stirring gently, and decorate the top with kiwi.
